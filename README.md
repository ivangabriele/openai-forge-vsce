## Requirements

**YOU MUST INSTALL OpenAI Forge Browser Extension or this extension can't work.**

The communication with ChatGPT is done through the Browser Extension, via WebSocket.

- [x] Send evaluation errors to ask ChatGPT for fixes
  - [x] Rust
- [x] Add a custom message to the generated prompt request (or don't)

### Bonus (for a better ChatGPT contextualization)
