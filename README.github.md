## Requirements

**YOU MUST INSTALL OpenAI Forge Browser Extension or this extension can't work.**

The communication with ChatGPT is done through the Browser Extension, via WebSocket.

## Features

Directly from Visual Studio Code, you can:

- [x] Send all the source code of one or multiple documents at once
- [x] Send evaluation errors to ask ChatGPT for fixes
  - [x] Rust
- [x] Add a custom message to the generated prompt request (or don't)

### Bonus (for a better ChatGPT contextualization)

- [x] Automatically include documents relative in prompt
- [x] Automatically "guess" and include some project information in the prompt header (can be disabled in settings)
